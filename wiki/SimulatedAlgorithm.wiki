#summary The algorithm we are simulating

= Application Specification =

 * Delay tolerant
 * Loss tolerant
 * Relatively limited packet size (say 64 kb)
 * Independent packets - ie no segmentation and reassembly OR use of fountain/erasure ECCs (ex. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_code raptor codes])

= Terminology =

 * We are dealing with task-oriented mobility in ferries (defn from [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=989483] - this sources deals with message oriented mobility)
 * I was originally considering a scheme where nodes cluster and gateway nodes are responsible for communicating with ferries (terminology from section 6 of [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=989483])

= Simplifications =

 * All or nothing wireless links (ie no fading - either two nodes can transmit or they cant)

= General Considerations =

 * Packet timeout (from [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=989483])
 * Location aware partitions and ferries (?)
 * Routing algorithm vs a simpler delivery algorithm
