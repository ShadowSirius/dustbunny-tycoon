=Title=
Machine to machine communication in ad-hoc mesh networks

=Abstract=
Machine to machine communication has long been considered a feature of the next technological age. Networking options available today are either too expensive or cumbersome to justify the information they are able to  provide (such as dedicated wired Ethernet or cellular data modems), or do not provide uniform connectivity (such as !WiFi). An alternate solution is to use ad-hoc mesh networking. This project will simulate either !ZigBee or 802.11s mesh networks in OPNET analyzing delay and packet loss. Time permitting, it will then be extended to simulate and analyze to store-carry-forward or message ferrying techniques in sparse and partitioned networks.
