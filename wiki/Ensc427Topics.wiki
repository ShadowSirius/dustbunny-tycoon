To do

= WiMAX/3G !WiFi Access Point =

Using WiMAX as the access point for delivering Wi-Fi connection to its devices:
 * basically WiMAX and Wi-Fi together.  (a router device can supply this service)
 * performance evaluation of VoIP, video-streaming, or Video On Demand (VOD) 

There's a good document on this, and please glance this as well to better understand.
